# The TODO list

Foobricator is still under construction and needs a lot of spec author support.

##  A GUI

Foobricator could really use an author GUI which provides a realtime sample output as well as intellisense support based on the schema

##  Tests

We are currently working on building tests for the foobricator that verify integrity on builds. 


##  Code Documentation

The code still needs internal documentation
